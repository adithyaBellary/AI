      <h2>Assignment 2: Smart Manufacturing, Two-Player Games</h2>
      <h3>Due at: Monday, March 12, 11:59 PM</h3>
      <p>
        In this assignment, you will build search algorithms
	specialized for two types of special problems: planning a
	shipping logistics problem, and planning the actions of an
	agent that plays a game.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are free to use any high-level programming languages you
        are comfortable with, including but not limited to Java, C++,
        Python, and MATLAB.  You have the option of working in groups
        of up to three people, all of whom should take this course for
        the same number of credit hours.  We focus on the entire
        problem solving process and you should hand in <b>the code</b>
        with your implementation (as a ZIP file) and <b>a written
        report</b> with your analysis (as a PDF, separate from the ZIP
        file).
      </p>
      <p>
        Point totals are listed next to each section header.
        Three-credit students can earn a maximum of 24 points plus 6
        extra credit points, whereas four-credit students can earn a
        maximum of 32 points plus 8 extra credit points.  Four-credit
        students are required to finish Part 2, and can try Part 2
        extra credit section for extra credit.  Three-credit students
        can try Part 2 for extra credit, but are not supposed to
        finish Part 2 extra credit section since your extra credit
        points will be capped for balance.

      <h2>Part 1: Smart Manufacturing</h2>
      <a name="part1.1">
        <h3>1.1 Planning Using A* Search (for everyone; 8 points)</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	You are the owner of a smart manufacturing company, with
	factories in five different cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago,
	Denver, and Edmonton.  Each factory makes a different type of
	component: for convenience, let's call the components A, B, C,
	D, and E.  The locations of your factories are a bit
	inconvenient to one another; the following table gives the
	distance (in miles) from one factory to another.
	<table>
	  <tbody><tr>
	    <th>Distance</th>
	    <th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th><th>D</th><th>E</th></tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>A</th><td>0</td><td>1064</td><td>673</td><td>1401</td>
	    <td>277</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>B</th><td>1064</td><td>0</td><td>958</td><td>1934</td>
	    <td>337</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>C</th><td>673</td><td>958</td><td>0</td><td>1001</td>
	    <td>399</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>D</th><td>1401</td><td>1934</td><td>1001</td><td>0</td>
	    <td>387</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>E</th><td>277</td><td>337</td><td>399</td><td>387</td>
	    <td>0</td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody></table>
      </p>
      <p>
	From those components, you manufacture five different types of
	widgets.  Each widget is composed of five widgets of different
	types, as follows:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>Widget 1 = Components AEDCA</li>
	  <li>Widget 2 = Components BEACD</li>
	  <li>Widget 3 = Components BABCE</li>
	  <li>Widget 4 = Components DADBD</li>
	  <li>Widget 5 = Components BECBD</li>
	</ul>
	Thus, for example, widget 1 is manufactured by building
	components A, E, D, C, and A, in that order.  Each
	component can only be added once the previous components
	are already in place; you can't manufacture it in advance.
      <p></p>
      <p>
	Every day, you put five empty widgets in a truck, and the
	truck visits factories in sequence as necessary to make all
	five widgets.  While you're at factory A, you can add
	component A to any widget that needs it, but you can't work
	ahead. The truck must visit all of the factories necessary to
	make all five widgets, in the order specified by the widgets.
	In other words, you need to come up with a sequence of
	letters that contains each of the sequences above as
	a subsequence.  Here are some example solutions:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>AEDCABEACDBABCEDADBDBECBD (25 stops)</li>
	  <li>ABBDBEEAAEDABDCCCCBBADEDD (25 stops)</li>
	  <li>ABDBEAEDABDCBADED (17 stops)</li>
	</ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>
	The goal of this assignment is to implement A* search that will
	find two different factory sequences:
	</p><ol>
	  <li>First, find the factory sequence with the smallest number of
	    stops (the smallest number of factories visited).
	  </li>
	  <li>Second, find the factory sequence with the smallest number
	    of miles traveled.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>
	Solve this problem using A* search.  Your report should specify
	your state representation, actions, and your heuristic.
	The heuristic need not be very smart, but it needs to be non-zero,
	and it needs to be admissible and consistent.
      </p>

	<h3>1.2: Planning Using a Planning Graph (4 points required
	  for 4-credit students; 2 extra credit points optional for
	  3-credit students)</h3>
      </a>
      
      <p>
	Implement the <code>GRAPHPLAN</code> algorith, as described in
	section 10.3.2 of the textbook, and in
	<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370296000471">this
	article</a>.  In this algorithm, you will create a graph in
	which each level of the graph is a list of (variable=value at
	time t) assignments (called "fluents"), and a list of mutex
	(mutually exclusive) liks among the fluents.  Levels are
	linked by actions, such as "travel from city A to city B."
	When you reach a level at which all of the goal conditions are
	non-mutex, you attempt a backward search to find a sequence of
	actions.  If the backward search fails, you add another level
	to the graph and try again.
      </p>
      <p>
	Use the planning graph to find the minimum-distance sequence
	of factories.  Hand in a plot of the lowest-distance solution
	resulting from a graph with N, N+1, ... levels, where N is the
	first level with any solution.
      </p>

      <a name="part1.3">
	<h3>1.3 Extra Credit (2 points each)</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	Extra credit tasks are worth up to two points each, up to a
	maximum of 25 percent (maximum extra credit = 6 points for
	3-credit students, 8 points for 4-credit students).
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Implement a random problem generator, that randomly
	  generates five widget definitions of length N, where N is a
	  parameter that you can specify (in the required problem,
	  N=5).  Hand in a plot of the number of nodes expanded by
	  each of your two A* search algorithms, as a function of N,
	  for 3&lt;=N&lt;=8.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Implement uniform cost search (Dijkstra's algorithm) for
	  each of the two problems specified in part 1.1 (minimum
	  number of stops, minimum distance traveled).  Compare the
	  number of nodes expanded using uniform cost search versus A*.
	</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Part 2: Game of Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row)</h2>
      <p>Created by Zhonghao Wang</p>

      <p>
	The goal of this part of the assignment is to implement an
	agent to play a simple 2-player zero-sum game called Gomoku.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Rules of the Game:</b> This game plays with stones of two
      colors (red and blue in these figures), on a board with 49 empty
      spaces arranged in a 7x7 grid.  Players alternate turns placing
      a stone of their color on an empty intersection (in these
      instructions, the player who goes first uses the red stones, and
      the player who goes second uses the blue stones). The winner is
      the player who first forms an unbroken chain of five stones
      horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is a tie if
      all intersections are filled up with stones but neither side
      wins the game.
      </p>

      <a name="part2.1">
	<h3>Part 2.1 (4 points for all): Reflex Agent</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	The goal of this section is to create a reflex agent
	following a set of pre-specified rules, so that, given the
	same initial board position, the reflex agent will always
	react in exactly the same way. It uses the following strategies:
	</p><ol>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Check whether the agent side is going to win by placing
	      just one more stone. If so, place the stone which wins
	      the game. For example, 4 blue stones form an unbroken
	      chain shown in figure 1. The agent at the blue side
	      would place a stone on either head of the chain, (0, 4)
	      or (5, 4), to win the game. To break a tie, choose a
	      move in the following order: left &gt; down &gt; right &gt;
	      up. Therefore, (0, 4) would be the move to make.
            </p>
            <p align="center">

	      Figure 1: Illustration of reflex agent rule #1
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Then check whether the opponent has an unbroken chain
	      formed by 4 stones and has an empty intersection on either
	      head of the chain. If so, place a stone on the empty
	      intersection. In the case shown in figure 2, the agent at
	      the blue side would put a stone on (5, 3) to prevent the
	      red side winning the game.
	    </p>
	    <p align="center">

	      Figure 2: Illustration of reflex agent rule #2
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Check whether the opponent has an unbroken chain formed by
	      3 stones and has empty spaces on both ends of the
	      chain. If so, place a stone on an empty space at one end
	      of the chain.  Choose which end of the chain to fill
	      following the order: left &gt; down &gt; right &gt; up. In figure
	      3, the agent at the blue side would place a stone on
	      either (1, 4) or (5, 4). To break a tie, (1, 4) would be
	      chosen.
	    </p>
	    <p align="center">
	      <img src="./CS 440_ECE 448 Assignment 2_files/mp2figure3.png"><br>
	      Figure 3: Illustration of reflex agent rule #3
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      If none of the previous conditions hold, then find all
	      possible sequences of 5 consecutive spaces that contain
	      none of the opponent's stones.  Call each such block a
	      "winning block," because it's a block in which victory
	      is still possible. Then, find the winning block which
	      has the largest number of the agent's stones. Last, in
	      the winning block, place a stone next to a stone already
	      in the winning block on board. You may find multiple
	      winning blocks or multiple positions within a winning
	      block to place a stone. To break a tie, find the
	      position which is farthest to the left; among those
	      which are farthest to the left, find the position which
	      is closest to the bottom.  For example, in figure 4, the
	      agent at the red side would place a stone on (0, 1).

	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p><b>Special rule for the agent's first move:</b> For the
	      very first move, you can implement any strategy you
	      like.  You can follow rule #4 above (by playing in the
	      bottom left corner), or you can play at random, or you
	      can make an optimal move (in the middle), whatever you
	      like.  This applies only to each player's first move;
	      each player's second move must follow rules #1-#4.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>
	Test your reflex agent to make sure it responds, as indicated,
	to the four examples shown above.

      <a name="part2.2">
	<h3>2.2 Minimax and Alpha-beta Agents (12 points for all)</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	Implement both minimax search and alpha-beta search agents.
	Implement your minimax and alpha-beta agents so that each of
	them searches to a depth of three (agent moves, opponent
	moves, agent moves, and then evaluation function is applied to
	evaluate the board position).  Test your minimax and
	alpha-beta agents to make sure that, when given the same board
	position, they both produce exactly the same move, but the
	alpha-beta agent comes up with that move after expanding fewer
	nodes in the search tree.
      </p>
      <p>
	Design an evaluation function that is accurate enough to permit
	your minimax and alpha-beta agents to beat the reflex agent.
	Give the same evaluation function to both the minimax and
	alpha-beta agents.  Describe your evaluation function in your
	report.
      </p>

	<h3>Part 2.3 Stochastic search (4 points required for 4-credit
	  students; 2 points extra credit for 3-credit students)</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	Implement a Stochastic-search agent for the 7x7 Gomoku game.
	Your Stochastic-search agent should be an alpha-beta agent
	with a depth of 2, but the value of each leaf node in the
	search tree should be estimated by generating N random games
	from that leaf position.  Experiment a little with the
	following parameters, and be ready to defend your choices
	based on either experimental or theoretical arguments, e.g.,
	by considering the quality of your result versus computational
	complexity.
	</p><ul>
	  <li><b>Policy&gt;</b> At each step of the simulation, how do
	    you decide where to play?</li>
	  <li><b>Breadth:</b> How many simulations do you use, from
	    each board position, to determine its value?
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Depth:</b> If you wish, you can abandon a simulation
	    whenever it exceeds some maximum simulation depth.  If so,
	    what depth makes sense?  Why?</li>
	  <li><b>Value:</b> How do you estimate the value of a board
	    position based on the simulations? For example, how much
	    is a tie worth?  How much is it worth if a game has to be
	    abandoned because it exceeds the maximum simulation
	    depth?</li>

	<li>
	  Use supervised learning to estimate an evaluation function:
	  (1) randomly generate a large number of sample games, (2)
	  implement a function that featurizes each board position,
	  and estimates the value based on those features, e.g., using
	  linear regression as described in lecture.  Turn in both

        <h2>Report Checklist</h2>
      </a>
      Your report should briefly describe your implementation and
      fully answer the questions for every part of the assignment.
      Your description should focus on the most "interesting" aspects
      of your solution, i.e., any non-obvious implementation choices
      and parameter settings, and what you have found to be especially
      important for getting good performance. Feel free to include
      pseudocode or figures if they are needed to clarify your
      approach. Your report should be self-contained and it should
      (ideally) make it possible for us to understand your solution
      without having to run your source code.  For full credit, in
      addition to the algorithm descriptions, your report should
      include the following.

	      Provide a figure or table showing, as a function of the
	      graph level, each of the following facts about your
	      planning graph.  The number of levels in the graph
	      should be large enough that (1) there is at least one
	      solution from the last level, and (2) the number of
	      mutex links, and the number of miles traveled by the
	      shortest path from that level, are unchanged between the
	      second-to-last and last level of the graph.
	      <ul>
		<li>The number of fluents at that level of the graph
		(integer)</li>
		<li>The number of mutex links (integer)</li>
		<li>Whether or not all of the goal fluents are

	      were played ('A', 'B', 'C', etc.).  You may submit your
	      final board position as a plaintext matrix, or as a
	      graphic, but you MUST show us the order of play using
	      consecutive letters.  Note: since the first two moves
	      are given to you, the special first-move rule (rule #5)
	      doesn't apply; all remaining moves must follow rules

	      You may submit your final board position as a plaintext
	      matrix, or as a graphic, but you MUST show us the order
	      of play using consecutive letters.
	      <ol>
		<li>alpha-beta vs. minimax </li>
		<li>minimax vs. alpha-beta </li>
		<li>alpha-beta vs. reflex </li>
		<li>reflex vs. alpha-beta </li>
		<li>reflex vs. minimax </li>
		<li>minimax vs. reflex </li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      For the alpha-beta vs. minimax and minimax
	      vs. alpha-beta match-ups, provide a table showing, as a
	      function of the move number, how many nodes in the
	      search tree were expanded by each agent in order to find
	      its move. The table should look something like this, but
	      with different numbers:
	      <table>
		<tbody><tr><th>move</th><th>Nodes expanded, red</th>
		  <th>Nodes expanded, blue</th></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>156748</td><td>96400</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>102354</td><td>74300</td></tr>
		<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	      </tbody></table>
	    </li><li>
	      Briefly analyze the relationship of the number of nodes
	      expanded per move between minimax agent and alpha-beta
	      agent.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Part 2.3 (required of 4-credit students)
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Implement the following two matchups, starting from an
	      empty board.  Here "alpha-beta" uses the evaluation
	      function you implemented in part 2.2:
	      <ol>
		<li>Stochastic-search vs. Alpha-beta with depth of 2</li>
		<li>Alpha-beta with depth of 2 vs. Stochastic-search</li>
	      </ol>
	      Print out the final state of each of these two boards.
	      Use '.' to denote empty intersections, use small letters
	      to denote each of the red stones (the first player to
	      play) in the order in which they were played ('a', 'b',
	      'c', etc.), and use capital letters to denote each of
	      the blue stones (second player) in the order in which
	      they were played ('A', 'B', 'C', etc.).  You may submit
	      your final board position as a plaintext matrix, or as a
	      graphic, but you MUST show us the order of play using
	      consecutive letters.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Answer the four questions listed in the assignment
	      description, about the policy, breadth, depth, and value
	      of your stochastic search algorithm.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Report the total number of simulated moves necessary for
	      the Stochastic-search agent to make each move in the
	      actual game, for each of the two match-ups.  Your table
	      should look something like the following, but with
	      different numbers:
	      <table>
		<tbody><tr><th>move</th><th>Game A</th><th>Game B</th></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>45637</td><td>139873</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>129864</td><td>34563</td></tr>
		<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	      </tbody></table>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Report the value of the move chosen by the
	      Stochastic-search agent at each move, in each of the two
	      games.  This value should be a number between 0 and 1,
	      specifying what the Stochastic-search agent believes to
	      be the probability that it will win the game if it makes
	      its best possible move.  Your table should look
	      something like the following, but with different
	      numbers:
	      <table>
		<tbody><tr><th>move</th><th>Game A</th><th>Game B</th></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td>0.536</td><td>0.598</td></tr>
		<tr><td>2</td><td>0.574</td><td>0.629</td></tr>
		<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	      </tbody></table>

	Multiple attempts will be allowed but only your last
        submission before the deadline will be graded. We have
        variable grace periods, so if you submit your files on 12:00
        am the next day due to network latency, do not panic.
        However, please never rely on the grace period and go any
        further.
	<b>We reserve the right to take off points for not following
	instructions.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	<b>Late policy:</b> For every day that your assignment is
        late, your score gets multiplied by 0.75.  The penalty gets
        saturated after four days, that is, you can still get up to
        about 32% of the original points by turning in the assignment
        at all.  Extensions without penalty of up to 72 hours will be
        granted for any assignment if you are ill (documented by a
        note from your doctor) or have a life-threatening emergency
        (documented by a note from the emergency dean, a court
        document, or some comparable documentation).  If you are part
        of a group, extension is granted only for the part of the
        project that is affected by the illness or emergency; this is
        the only reason for which separate submission of sub-projects
        is ever accepted.

          integrity, etc.</b>
