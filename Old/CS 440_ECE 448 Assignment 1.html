            <p>
                In this assignment, you will build general-purpose search algorithms and apply them to solving puzzles.
                In Part 1 (for everyone), you will be in charge of a "Pac-Man" agent
                that needs to find paths through mazes while eating one or more dots or "food pellets".
                In Part 2 (for four-credit students), you will tackle small instances of the Sokoban puzzle.

            </p><p>
                You are free to use any high-level programming languages you are comfortable with,
                including but not limited to Java, C++, Python, and MATLAB.
                You have the option of working in groups of up to three people,
                all of whom should take this course for the same number of credit hours.
                We focus on the entire problem solving process,
                and you should hand in both <b>the code</b> with your implementation and <b>a written report</b> with
                your analysis.

            </p><p>
            Three-credit students can earn a maximum of 24 points plus 6 extra credit points,
            whereas four-credit students can earn a maximum of 32 points plus 8 extra credit points.
            Four-credit students are required to finish Part 2, and can try Part 2 extra credit section for extra credit.
            Three-credit students can try Part 2 for extra credit, but are not suppoed to finish Part 2 extra credit section
            since your extra credit points will be capped for balance.

                <h3>1.1 Basic pathfinding</h3>

                <p>Consider the problem of finding the shortest path from a given start state while eating
                    one or more dots or "food pellets". The above image illustrates
                    the simple scenario of a single dot, which in this case can be viewed as the unique goal state.
                    Here, all step costs are equal to one.

                </p><p>Implement the state representation, transition model, and goal test needed for solving the problem
                    in the general case of multiple dots. For the state representation, besides your current position
                    in the maze, is there anything else you need to keep track of? For the goal test, keep in mind that
                    in
                    the case of multiple dots, the Pacman does not necessarily have a unique ending position.
                    Next, implement a unified top-level search routine that can work with
                    all of the following search strategies, as covered in class:

                </p><ul>
                    <li>Depth-first search;
                    </li><li>Breadth-first search;
                    </li><li>Greedy best-first search;
                    </li><li>A* search.
                </li></ul>

                For this part of the assignment, use the Manhattan distance from the current position to the goal
                as the heuristic function for greedy and A* search.

                <p>The maze layout will be given to you in a simple text format, where '%'
                    stands for walls, 'P' for the starting position, and '.' for the dot(s).
                    Run each of the four search strategies on the following inputs:
                </p></a><ul><a name="part1">
                    </a><li><a name="part1"></a><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/mediumMaze.txt">Medium maze</a>;
                    </li><li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/bigMaze.txt">Big maze</a>;
                    </li><li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/openMaze.txt">Open maze</a>.
                </li></ul>
                For each problem instance and each search algorithm, include the following in your report:

                <ul>
                    <li>The solution, displayed by putting a '.' in every maze square visited on the path.
                    </li><li>The path cost of the solution, defined as the number of steps taken to get from the initial
                        state to the goal state.
                    </li><li>Number of nodes expanded by the search algorithm.
                </li></ul>
                This section is worth <b>16 points</b> for everyone.


                <h3>1.2: Search with multiple dots</h3>

                Now consider the harder problem of finding the shortest path through a maze
                while hitting multiple dots. Once again, the Pacman is initially at P, but now
                there is no single goal position. Instead, the goal is achieved whenever the Pacman
                manages to eat all the dots. Once again, we assume unit step costs.

                <p>As instructed in 1.1, your state representation, transition model, and goal test
                    should already be adapted to deal with this scenario. The next challenge is to solve
                    the following inputs using A* search with an admissible heuristic designed by you:
                </p><ul>
                    <li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/tinySearch.txt">Tiny search</a>;
                    </li><li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/smallSearch.txt">Small search</a>;
                    </li><li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/mediumSearch.txt">Medium search</a>.
                </li></ul>

                <p>You should be able to handle the tiny search using uninformed BFS -- and in fact, it is a good
                    idea
                    to try that first for debugging purposes, to make sure your representation works with multiple
                    dots. However, to
                    successfully handle all the inputs, it is crucial to come up with a good heuristic. For full
                    credit,
                    your heuristic should be admissible and should permit you to find the solution for the medium
                    search
                    in a reasonable amount of time. In your report, explain the heuristic you chose, and discuss why
                    it is
                    admissible and whether it leads to an optimal solution.

                </p><p>For each maze, give the solution cost and the number of nodes expanded.
                    Show your solution by numbering the dots in the order in which you
                    reach them (once you run out of numbers, use lowercase letters, and if you run out of those,
                    uppercase letters).

                </p><p> This section is worth <b>8 points</b> for everyone.

                </p><h3>1.2 Extra Credit: Suboptimal search</h3>

                Sometimes, even with A* search and a good heuristic, finding the optimal path through all the dots is
                hard.
                In these cases, we would still like to find a reasonably good path, quickly. Write a suboptimal search
                algorithm that will do a good job on <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/bigDots.txt">this big maze</a>.
                Your algorithm could either be A* search with a non-admissible heuristic, or something different
                altogether.

                <p>In your report, discuss your approach and output the solution cost and number of expanded nodes.
                    You don't have to show the solution path unless
                    you can come up with a nice animation.
                </p><p> This section is worth <b>2 extra credit points</b> for everyone.

                </p><h3>Tips for Part 1</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li> In your implementation, make sure you get all the bookkeeping right. This includes handling
                        of repeated states (in particular, what happens when you find a better
                        path to a state already on the frontier) and saving the optimal solution
                        path. These topics have been extensively covered during lectures.<br><br>

                    </li><li> Pay attention to tiebreaking. If you have multiple nodes on the
                        frontier with the same minimum value of the evaluation function, the
                        speed of your search and the quality of the solution may depend on
                        which one you select for expansion.<br><br>

                    </li><li>Make sure you implement a unified top-level search algorithm that can take
                        each of the four strategies as special cases. In particular, while DFS can be implemented
                        very compactly using recursion, we want you to avoid this approach for the sake of the
                        assignment (among other things, you can much more easily exceed the maximum depth of the
                        recursion stack than if you explicitly represent the frontier as a stack).<br><br>

                    </li><li> In Part 1, you will be graded primarily on the correctness of your solution, not on the
                        efficiency and elegance of your data structures. For example, we don't
                        care whether your priority queue or repeated state detection uses
                        brute-force search, as long as you end up expanding (roughly) the
                        correct number of nodes and find the optimal solution. So, feel free
                        to use "dumb" data structures as long as it makes your life easier
                        and still enables you to find the solutions to all the inputs in a reasonable
                        amount of time. However, in Part 2, you will have to handle repeated state
                        detection more efficiently in order to successfully solve all the inputs.
                </li></ul>

                    </small>

                    <p>
                        In this part of the assignment, you will adapt your A* search to solve tiny instances of the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> puzzle. Here is the description
                        of the rules from Wikipedia:

                    </p><blockquote>
                        The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor
                        squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations. The player is
                        confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never
                        through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the
                        square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled.
                        The number of boxes is equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when
                        all boxes are at storage locations.
                    </blockquote>

                    You need to solve the four Sokoban instances below. In the following input files, '%' denotes
                    walls, 'b' denotes boxes, '.' denotes storage locations, and 'B' denotes boxes on top of storage
                    locations. The initial position of the agent is given by 'P'.

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece448/sp2018/assignment1/sokoban1.txt">Input 1</a>

                    </li></ul>

                    Implement the Sokoban transition model, then try to come up with interesting admissible
                    heuristics that expand as few nodes as possible. For full credit, you should run two versions of
                    search on each input: either uninformed search plus A* search with one heuristic, or A* search
                    with two different heuristics (probably at different levels of sophistication).

                    <p>
                        In your report, describe your heuristic(s) and justify whether they are admissible. For each
                        input and each method of search, give the number of moves needed to reach a goal
                        configuration, the number of nodes expanded, and the running time.
